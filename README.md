## About Craft CMS

Craft is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. It is optimized for bespoke web and application development, offering developers a clean slate to build out exactly what they want, rather than wrestling with a theme.

## Installing this boilerplate

Download or clone this repository and run:

``` sh
$ yarn
```

## Workflow

Use Node.js scripts to run build tools.

* `$ yarn watch` - Recompiles files whenever they change
* `$ yarn build` - Creates production ready code

After running `` $ yarn watch `` or `` $ yarn build ``, your deploy-ready code will be taken from the ``./src/`` directory and placed within the ``./web/build/`` and ``./templates/`` directories respectively.

Go through the repository to learn how things play together. This project is inspired by MilesHerndon’s [Craft CMS Project Boilerplate](https://craftcms.com) and has been adapted to my needs.
